### Main Page

- **Quick Response Buttons**: Users are greeted with three large, easy-to-tap buttons on the main page, each designed to cater to different emergencies:
  - "I'm feeling weird": For users who have ingested a substance and are beginning to feel unwell.
  - "I see something weird": For users who witness someone else exhibiting signs of a drug overdose or adverse reaction.
  - "I feel unsafe": For users who find themselves in an unsafe situation, possibly requiring immediate medical attention or intervention.

Each of these buttons is programmed to initiate a different protocol, which may include alerting emergency contacts, providing guidance on immediate steps to take, or directly contacting emergency services.

### User Profile

- **Personal Information**: The user profile contains critical personal information that can be invaluable during an emergency, including:
  - User ID
  - Full name
  - Sex
  - Age
  - Height and weight
  - Insurance ID
  
- **Emergency Contacts**: A 'Friends List' section allows users to input and update emergency contacts quickly. This list is vital for emergency responders and for alerting friends or family during an incident.

- **Add More**: Users have the option to add more contacts, ensuring that all necessary parties can be reached in an emergency.

### Emergency Response

- **911 Call Confirmation**: When a user taps the emergency button, the app confirms that 911 (or the local emergency service) has been called. This reassures the user that help is on the way and provides critical personal information that can be relayed to the responders, such as full name, sex, weight, height, and insurance ID, along with a Friends List for personal contacts who should be notified.

### Substance Information

- **Substance Identification**: In a scenario where a user feels unwell after substance use, the app offers a feature to help identify the possible substance involved, such as "You may have consumed Ketamine." This identification can aid in taking the correct steps to mitigate the effects and inform emergency services for a more effective response.

### Immediate Guidance

- **Do's and Don'ts**: Once a substance is identified, the app provides immediate guidance with clear "Do" and "Don't" instructions. For instance, it may advise the user to "Drink water, not alcohol" and "Don't be near dangerous objects." This can prevent the situation from worsening while waiting for help to arrive.

- **Scheduled Check-Ins**: The app promises to check in with the user soon, indicating that there will be follow-up to monitor the user's condition.

### Safety Features
